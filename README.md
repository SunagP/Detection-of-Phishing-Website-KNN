**PROJECT: Build a detector for Phishing websites (KNN)**

The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for the project “Build a detector for Phishing websites (KNN)” Apart from specifying the functional and non-functional requirements for the project, it also serves as an input for project scoping. 

# Project Objective
The purpose of the project is to use one or more of the classification algorithms to train a model on the Phishing website dataset in order to train a model which can detect phishing websites.

# Project Description and Scope
You are provided with the following resources that can be used as inputs for your model:
1.	A collection of website URLs for 11000+ websites. Each sample has 30 website parameters and then a class label identifying it as a phishing website or not (1 or -1).
2.	Code template containing these code blocks :
a.	Import modules (part 1)
b.	Load data function + input/output field descriptions
You are expected to write the code for a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data.


# Project Guidelines

**Begin by extracting the ipynb file.**<br>
1 : Build a phishing website classifier using KNN with no of neighbours as 5 and distance metric as “minkowski”.
Use 70% of data as training data and remaining 30% as test data.
